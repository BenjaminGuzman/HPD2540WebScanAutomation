# HPD2540WebScanAutomation
Utility script to automate scanning with an HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2540 All-in-One Printer

[scan-interval.js](scan-interval.js) is an script to add some util buttons to the printer UI to reduce the number of times you have to press the scan button.

## Usage

1. Copy the script

2. Go to the printer webpage

3. Paste the script in the browser dev tools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+c` to open dev tools).

4. Click **Start scan** to start the first scan and an interval will be set to automatically click the **Start scan** button every `n` seconds (defined with the slider next to the **Stop interval** button). You won't need to click the button again ðŸ˜‰ (although you still need to save the scan. See below).

## TODO's

- It'd be nice if the download (Save Image As...) process is also automated.

IDK how to do this with JS, I don't think it is possible or may require much more code and possibly reverse-engineer the web app.
