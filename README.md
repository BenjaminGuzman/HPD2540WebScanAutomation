# HPD2540WebScanAutomation
Utility script to automate scanning with an HP Deskjet Ink Advantage 2540 All-in-One Printer

[scan-interval.js](scan-interval.js) is an script to add some util buttons to the printer UI to reduce the number of times you have to press the scan button.

Before applying the script

The only thing you have to do is copy and paste the script in the browser dev tools.

## TODO's

- It'd be nice if the download (Save Image As...) process is also automated.

IDK how to do this with JS, I don't think it is possible or may require much more code and possibly reverse-engineer the web app.
